        <p>Asreen Zangana is a self-taught graphic designer and front-end website developer based in Brooklyn, with an emphasis on experimental and interactive coding. As a child of Iraqi political activists, their work gravitates towards 60s Polish and Cuban communist film posters, which helped shape their lawless art style and pay homage to their familial history. Using a multitude of different mediums to help communicate with their audience, they are able to provide interdisciplinary insights into their work, and to challenge conventional practices. Through a mixture of constructed and observational elements, they create a dreamlike world built into their work for viewers to experience.
            My work is influenced by 60’s polish and cuban film posters, and a touch of surrealism</p>
